## Student Results Management System ##

The aim is to build a system  to manage and analyze undergraduate students’ marks.
	
This application will be used by mainly undergraduate students themselves.  The batch administrator for each batch or student field administrators for each field of the batch register the courses (with course code, name, credits, coordinator  etc.) to the application .

The administrator can send a request to the relevant course coordinator the application  to upload final grades of the course with the relevant  link.  The course coordinator  should be able to upload the grades without login or sign up  to the system.  But if the coordinator wishes, they can sign up too. If the relevant coordinator uploads the results to the course, students won’t be able to edit those results further (results in close state).  If students have manually entered the results of the course , they will be replaced by the coordinator’s results.

If the coordinator hasn’t uploaded the results,  then students can enter their total final confirmed marks or grades through the application (results in open state). These marks will be saved, but students cannot see others’ grades.  The students should be able to calculate their current GPA.  The system can calculate the necessary  grades for each semester to achieve expected GPA in upcoming semesters, when the user enters the expected GPA. 

When continuous assessment  (quizzes, assignments, projects ) marks are entered for a particular course,  students should be able to get a calculated required exam marks for the expected grade of that course. According to the confirmed marks entered, the system shows the rank of the student of the batch and field.
